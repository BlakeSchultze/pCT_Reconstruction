Variable whose previous names were restored:

XX block_voxels_h  -> MLP_block_h 
XX path_voxels  -> MLP_h 
XX path_errors -> MLP_errors 
XX path_intersections -> MLP_intersections 
XX write_MLP_path -> write_MLP
XX write_MLP_paths -> write_MLPs 
XX read_MLP_paths -> read_MLPs
XX read_MLP_paths_error -> read_MLPs_error
XX OUTPUT_FOLDER_UNIQUE -> OUTPUT_TO_UNIQUE
XX MLP_PATHS_ERROR_FNAME -> MLP_PATHS_ERROR_FILENAME
XX num_paths -> num_MLPs
XX intersected_hull_h -> traversed_hull_h
XX intersected_hull_d -> traversed_hull_d

Variables (and data type in 1 case) whose new names were retained:

-(Paniz changed too) x_hull_h/d -> hull_h/d
-(never applied) bin_num_vector -> bin_number_vector
-(Paniz should do) block_counts_h  -> S_h 
-(compromise made with Paniz)chord_lengths -> A_ij_h/d
-(only appear in image_reconstruction commented)num_voxel_intersections_d -> S_d
-(Paniz to change) HULL_FILTER_RADIUS -> HULL_AVG_FILTER_RADIUS
x_update_h: double* -> float*
